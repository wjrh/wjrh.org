# How to Get Your Music Played
##### Will you play my music?
WJRH is a completely freeform radio station. This means that the station gives DJs time slots and each DJ selects all the music played on his or her show. DJs may play music from their personal collection and from the radio station library. There is minimal oversight of the music that is available for DJ consideration. We have a very large record collection and a lot of CDs in racks. We put up all the music we receive in a special 'new music' area before archiving them, but in the end what is played is in the DJs control.

##### Do you even listen to what we send you?
The Music Director is not responsible for listening to all music submissions. We let each individual DJ decide what to spin. DJs are free to check out your tunes whenever they want.

##### Do you have a medium or heavy rotation?
No. All live DJs play whatever they want. This could mean that they can rickroll you 10 times in a row.

##### Do you folks play unsigned bands?
Yes, unsigned bands are treated no differently than major label bands.

##### Could you listen to my MP3 and tell me if you like it?
We hardly have enough time to handle the quantity of tangible media as it is. We urge artists and labels to send music in a physical form. However, if you put [#submission](/contact) in your subject line and if it is direcly sent to us, can take a look at it.

##### So is there nothing I can do to get my CD played on WJRH?
Well, take a gander at our playlists, show descriptions and listen to the streams. Then determine if your music is suitable for (m)any of these shows. Contacting DJs directly is your best bet.
