# Joining WJRH

One way to join WJRH is to become a DJ on the radio station. In the beginning of every broadcasting season (Spring, Summer and Fall semesters at Lafayette College) our program director solicits requests to become a DJ in the station through Lafayette College campus wide email lists as well as the general WJRH interest list. You may subscribe by sending a blank email to `wjrh-join@mailman.lafayette.edu` and follow the confirmation information sent to you.

You can join the station as a DJ anytime, however, in the beginning of every season when the schedule is reset, we hold a general body meeting to quickly collect time slot requests and sort out any questions DJs might have. Because of this, if you are considering to join the station in the beginning of a semester, we ask you to attend this meeting, typically held in the second week of every semester. If we are past the general body meeting of the season, please contact the program director and check if there are any timeslots available to you.

New schedules are publised in the beginning of every season on our website and shows start typically on the second weeks on Summer and Spring and on the third week of the Fall semester. Exact semester schedules can be found on the Lafayette College website.
